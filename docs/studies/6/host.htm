<h1>Study 6: Integration</h1>

<p>This document(s) shall integrat the concepts of the previous studies.</p>

<h2>Calculator Test</h2>

<p>Combined Results</p>
<div class="test-summary combined"></div>

<p>This Document</p>
<div class="test-summary host-document"></div>

<script>
test.register ( "<p>The following tests probe the existence of Calculator methods:</p>" ,
	function ( ) {
	test.check( "Calculator.add !== undefined" );
	test.check( "Calculator.multiply !== undefined" );
	} ) ;
</script>

<iframe class="test-document" src="test-add.htm"></iframe>

<script type="module">
import * as Calculator from "./calculator.js";
window.Calculator = Calculator;
import * as Dom from "./dom.js" ;
window.Dom = Dom;
test.initPage( );
test.run( );
</script>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p>We have a race condition between setting up iframe test event handlers and tests running in the hosted (child) documents. An iframe test event handlers cannot be registererd with the hosted document before that document is loaded. The registration is delayed until the related <tt>window.load</tt> event handler triggers. Unfortunately, the tests in the hosted document are started, before host document has an opportunity to perform the TestExecuted event handler registration. As a result, the events are lost.</p>

<p>To change that behavior, all child documents must not start their test runs until a command from their parent document is received.</p>
